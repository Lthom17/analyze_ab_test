# analyze_ab_test

The purpose of this project is to assist an e-commerce business in understanding the results of an A/B test run different versions of their landing page. The versions of the landing page consist of the old page and a newly dedveloped landing page. The company's goal for their new page is to try and increase the number of users who "convert" to customers. To "convert" means that the user has decided to pay for the company's product. I will complete a full analysis of the A/B test and give my thoughts and recommendation on landing page in my conclusion.

Files included are...
1.) ab_data.csv - includes customer data
